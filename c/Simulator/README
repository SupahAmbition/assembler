PROJECT BY: Tyler Beverley And Mike Hawkins

Makefile 
Pretty basic make file. Two rules. A clean rule and an all rule.  
All rule: Compiles the simulator.c file into a executable program. 


simulator.c 
this file contains all the multicycle simulator code for the multicycle simulator part of the project. 
to see a more detailed explanation see the multi_simulator_explaination.pdf

BENCHMARKS:
addNandTest -> Assembly code for the program that is heavy on Add and Nand instructions
addNandMC	-> Machine code the program add/nand program. 
beqTest 	-> Assembly code for the program that is heavy on beq instructions. 
beqMC 		-> Machine code for the beq program. 
jalrTest 	-> Assembly code for the program that is heavy on jalr instructions. 
				NOTE: Because of the way we wrote our jalr to run, this program takes 
					a bit longer to run than the others... 
jalrMC 		-> machine code for the jalr program. 



TESTCASES:
each test case here is labeled. for each test case there is an associated testmc file
that stores the machine code for that file. e.g. test1's machince code file will be test1mc

test1 -> 	checks to make sure lw and add are functioning properly.
test2 -> 	The machine code from the example in the pdf. No associated assembly file, only the machine code . 
test3 -> 	test nand
test4 -> 	test lw/sw
test5 -> 	test beq	
test6 -> 	test jalr	
test7 ->  	test add
test8 -> 	test negative offset beq (infinite loop when works)
